_This is a submission for DEV Challenge v24.03.20, Glam Up My Markup: Camp Activities_

## What I Built

I built an inquiry web app for camping activities using the starter code with vite vanilla javascript. 
Since a plain form leavs a rather "boring" impression - at least for me -, 
I'm trying to capture the atmosphere of a possible user and make a "boring" form somehow interesting. 
Therefore I picked a background image by [Kevin Erdvig](https://unsplash.com/photos/camping-under-black-sky-k7fUP9RQj3Y) and found a matching favicon.
Then added some css "glamping" style with glowing effects to headline and labels, and rounded some borders for a smooth and welcoming appearence. 
I chose to handle user submission with [toastify-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/toastify-js), so that there's only a brief notification for the user after hitting the button. 



## Demo

You can find the project [here](https://campactivitychallenge.netlify.app/) and the code [here](https://github.com/CipiVlad/camp_activity_dev_to_challenge.git).

## Journey

Although the purpose of the user visiting this web app is to get a quick info, it doesn't mean to lack of style. So taking this user's view, finding the fitting background I really enjoyed working on the forms look and felt challenged to get something done. Till now I didn't style web apps with "glowing" effcts, as there were no use cases for that and for the first time I used the text-shadow and the css selector label[for=""]. So now I know better :)
